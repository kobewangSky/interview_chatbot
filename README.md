- **Customizable Databases**: Each company can have its own CSV database with pre-processed embeddings to improve chatbot performance.
- **Real-time Chat**: Users can ask questions and receive responses in real-time.
- **Website Scraper**: Ability to scrape website content and save it into a file for processing.
- **Text Summarization and Embeddings**: The system supports breaking large documents into chunks and generating embeddings and summaries, which are used to answer queries.
