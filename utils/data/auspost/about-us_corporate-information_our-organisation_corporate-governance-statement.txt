Corporate Governance Statement
Corporate Governance Statement for financial year 2022/23
This Corporate Government Statement was approved by the Board of the Australian Postal Corporation (Australia Post / the Corporation) on 29 August 2023.
Our approach to Corporate Governance
Australia Post maintains a comprehensive system of corporate governance practices designed to provide appropriate levels of governance, disclosure and accountability.

These practices derive principally from the provisions of the Australian Postal Corporation Act 1989 (APC Act) and the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013 (PGPA Act) and guidance in the Commonwealth Government Business Enterprises – Governance and Oversight Guidelines (GBE Guidelines). Our governance framework in 2022/23 was also guided by the ASX Corporate Governance Council’s Corporate Governance Principles and Recommendations (4th Edition) (ASX Principles).
