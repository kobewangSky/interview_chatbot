We switched to your preferred providers and we had no out of pocket expense for the children's mouth guards, along with several other dental services ðŸ‘Œ. Safe sports, cool-coloured mouths and sustainability - and my daughter chose a biodegradable tree green mouth guard! Thanks CBHS. Manda B Our family has full private health with CBHS âˆ’ always have and definitely always will now. CBHS helped my family immensely, mainly my mother who died of brain cancer a few years ago. Without the help of CBHS we would have lost our family home to pay for all the hospital and medical bills and my dad would have been forced to work rather than care for my mother in her final days. CBHS not only gave us peace of mind with finances but peace of mind with life, freeing us up to be with Mum. Nicole M Latest articles View More 190.7% compared to 85.6% across the industry.
