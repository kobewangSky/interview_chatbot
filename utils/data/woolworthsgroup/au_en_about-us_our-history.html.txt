The bag ban also included Big W stores. We also launch the Junior Landcare Grants Program across Australia. 2018 2018 A name change and digital launch In December 2017, the Annual General Meeting of shareholders approves the change of our company name from Woolworths Limited to Woolworths Group Limited. The same year, we also create a new business and innovation arm, WooliesX, which combines our digital, e-commerce, data and customer divisions. 2017 2017 Partners with OzHarvest In 2014, Woolworths Group becomes a national food rescue partner with Australian food rescue organisation, OzHarvest. Woolworths is OzHarvest’s biggest food donor, providing over half of the organisation’s rescued food, and supporting over 1800 charities. 2014 2014 20 years on the Australian Stock Exchange Woolworths purchases a stake in the analytics firm Quantium. With the aim of growing the business using improving customer analytics capability. 2013 2013 Acquisition of Cellarmasters Taking our drink business online. Since its humble beginnings in 1982, Cellarmasters has grown to become one of the largest direct wine marketers in the world. Each week, around 21,000 cases of wine leave our Barossa Valley warehouses to be delivered straight to the front doors of thousands of customers around the country. Woolworths acquired the Cellarmasters business in 2011. 2011 2011 Macro Own Brand launches Lifting the health of the nation. Macro Own Brand launches to make our customers feel right at home with ingredients that are loaded with nutritious goodness. The range offers products that are low in fat, sugar and salt, while being high in good stuff, like protein, fibre, calcium and vitamins. 2010 2010 DSE joint venture in India Woolworths opens the first Croma store in Mumbai, India. Croma is India’s first chain of multi-brand outlets for consumer electronics and durable products. As their wholesaler, we’re responsible for providing their entire inventory of stock – as well as lending a hand with their IT, training and store layout. 2006 2006 Woolworths acquires Foodland New Zealand Woolworths reaches an arrangement to acquire from Foodland Australia Limited (FAL) their New Zealand supermarket businesses, together with 22 Action stores in Australia. 2005 2005 Acquisition of Australian Leisure and Hospitality Taking our drinks and hotel operations to a whole new level. In 2004, our drink and hotel operations take a gigantic leap forward with the acquisition of Australian Leisure and Hospitality Limited. 2004 2004 Project Refresh kicks-off Time for a whole new way of doing business. Project Refresh was our home-grown business change program – designed to help us realign and transform the way we managed the Group. Results driven and focused on best practice, our first task was to find ways to improve efficiency and eliminate waste and duplication. 1999 1999 19 May 1993 Woolworths Share Float A year of getting back on our feet. On 19 May 1993, our Chairman, Paul Simons announces that shares in the business would be offered to the public in Australia’s largest ever share float. The company was re-listed on the stock exchange over the following month and 19,000 Woolworths employees were offered shares under our new Employee Share Plan. 1993 1993 Woolworths taken over by IEL The end of the road for an Australian icon? For the first time in 65 years, no final dividend is recommended or paid on Woolworths’ shares. The following year, IEL advised of an unconditional offer for all shares to be bought at $3.65 cash per share. Our Directors recommended acceptance of this offer, and on 28 April 1989 – having acquired 98.4% of our shares – IEL preceded with the compulsory acquisition of the remaining Woolworths shares. Later that year, the Woolworths Group’s shares were de-listed and the company no longer appeared on the Stock Exchange. 1989 1989 The Fresh Food People The year we became the the Fresh Food People. Woolworths launches the “Fresh Food People” campaign after implementing a new buying, merchandising and training program across our fresh food departments. This focus on fresh foods clearly differentiates us from other supermarkets, and has remained our key selling point and philosophy to this day. 1987 1987 Acquisition of Safeway A good name in safe hands. American Safeway Inc. had operated in Australia since 1963. But in 1985, Woolworths acquires all 126 of its Australian stores. The following year, every Woolworths supermarket in Victoria was rebranded with the Safeway look and feel to reflect the change. 1985 1985 Acquisition of Dick Smith The start of our exciting journey into the world of electronics retail. In 1981, Woolworths acquireds 60% of the companies owned and operated by Dick Smith Electronics (the remaining 40% would follow in 1983). Later, in 2001, we add Tandy to the Dick Smiths Electronics Division, and in 1996, we open the first Dick Smith PowerHouse, in Bankstown, NSW. 1981 1981 The first BIG W discount department store Australia gets a taste for discounts with its first BIG W discount department store. When BIG W opened its doors for business in Tamworth, NSW, nobody expected it to be the enormous success it was. But by the end of 1978, we had opened 13 BIG W discount stores across all five states and even one in the ACT. 1976 1976 The launch of Own Brands In 1973, Woolworths introduces our first range of Own Brands. From 1930, we had always marketed our products with the Woolworths logo (or under the house name, Judith Arden). But in 1973, we decided to introduce a comprehensive range of ‘Own Brands,' which were equal to - or better in quality - than market-leading brands. Ten years later, this was superseded by our ‘Home Brands’ offering: 150 products – mostly basic food and grocery lines – in generic black and white packaging with a distinctive red and white Home Brand logo. Later, in 2005, we added ‘Woolworths Select’ – a more premium offering designed to cater to those looking for a higher standard of quality. 1973 1973 Quality comes first Woolworths steps up to the plate in terms of quality control. In 1964, we decide to take our commitment to quality to the next level by opening our very own Quality Assurance Laboratory – independent of the buying department and suppliers. While still responsible for testing foodstuffs, a large part of our analysts’ job was to check samples of general merchandise to make sure the quality expected by our customers was the quality we delivered. 1969 1969 Raise a toast The next few decades would see us become one of Australia’s favourite drinks retailers. In 1960, Woolworths purchases a store that already had a limited license to sell alcohol. Spotting an opportunity for growth, other stores followed suit with a raft of license applications throughout the 1960s and 70s. By 1984, all Group stores with a drinks license were consolidated into one trading unit and in 1998 we entered into contracts with Dan Murphy. Hot on the heels of this success, we opened our first premium drinks store – First Estate – in 2001, and established BWS. 1961 1961 The age of the supermarket Our first supermarket heralds a new beginning for Woolworths. In 1960, we began to develop what we now know as purpose-built supermarkets. Under one roof – with adjacent parking – customers could access a range of food and variety goods at value prices. Our first – built in Warrawong, New South Wales – was such a success that store plans still on the drawing board, were reviewed and immediately converted to adopt the new model. 1960 1960 Our 300th store There are celebrations all round the day we open our 300th store. Queues line the block as we prepare to open the doors of our 300th store, in Wentworthville NSW. In just four years, we experience unprecedented growth, thanks to the revolution of self-service and dedicated food stores. The acquisition of Queensland’s BCC stores also helped us open a further 32 stores throughout the state. The swinging 60s were coming, and we were ready for them. 1959 1959 Our first food stores Woolworths’ first dedicated food store opens in Sydney’s Dee Why in 1957. The Grocery range was limited, but included fresh vegetables, delicatessen items and packaged fresh meat sold out of refrigerated cabinets. 1957 1957 Our first self-service stores By 1955, shoppers were doing it for themselves. Although common place today, Woolworths’ first self-service stores revolutionises the shopping experience – allowing customers to select their purchases in-store and pay at cash registers at the front. Our first self-service store – located in Sydney’s Beverley Hills – was quickly followed by dozens of other Woolworths stores wanting to jump on board with this pioneering formula. 1955 1955 The War Years World War II changed everything for Woolworths, as we were called to do our duty. World War II brought the company’s development to a halt as hundreds of Woolworths’ men and women left their posts to fight for their country. Throughout the war, company employees who’d stayed at home sent regular company-subsidised parcels and letters to colleagues on the frontline. They also raised significant funds to support ambulances and other comfort funds. 1940 1940 Staff Assurance scheme launched Giving the team security in their retirement. Our success meant that we were in a position to create an assurance scheme that would provide Woolworths employees with the security they needed in their retirement. After all, these were the people that had seen us through the great depression – the ones who’d worked tirelessly to help us come out, unscathed, on the other side. The scheme was made retrospective to the company’s foundation (all the way back to 1924) so that all employees would be covered from the day they joined the team. 1939 1939 Taking over the airwaves Radio advertising was the next big thing and we wanted in on it. Up until the mid-1930s, we had always advertised in the daily newspapers. But in 1937, we decided to give the relatively new medium of radio a go – sponsoring the popular evening programme, ‘Rhythm Round Up’ on Station GB, Sydney. Not only did this launch a new phase of our development, it also helped kick-off the career of leading radio personality, Jack Davey, who up until becoming the Woolworths compere, was relatively unknown. 1937 1937 Branching out We officially become a ‘chain’ when our second store openes on 6 August 1927. It was never our intention to develop into a ‘chain’, but when we were offered a bargain-priced premises on Queen Street in Brisbane, we had to accept it. The depression years were wreaking havoc across the world, but for some reason, Woolworths continued to grow. In 1926, we became the first variety chain in the world to introduce receipt-printing cash registers. In 1929, we opened our first store in New Zealand and by 1930, we had 16 stores across New South Wales, Queensland, Western Australia and New Zealand. 1927 1927 5 Dec 1924 Woolworths begins On Friday, 5 December 1924, Woolworths Stupendous Bargain Basement opens for business in Sydney's Imperial Arcade. Percy Christmas, Founding CEO said of the event: ‘Every city needs a Woolworths: Sydney has it now. Every man, woman and child needs a handy place where good things are cheap.’ Little did he know, that more than 99 years later, these words would still form the basis of our team philosophy and values. 1924 1924 About us We are on a mission to deliver the best in convenience, value and quality for our customers.
