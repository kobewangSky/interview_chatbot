Kobe is a Senior AI Engineer with 8 years of experience, specializing in end-to-end AI solutions, particularly in AI model optimization and edge computing. He has worked with top organizations like Digital Domain, National Tsing Hua University, black.ai, and Lumachain, where he contributed to advanced AI solutions.
At Digital Domain, Kobe developed cutting-edge face tracking and 3D face reconstruction models using deep learning. He also built a digital avatar video call app by integrating Unreal Engine with Java, JNI, and C++, defining its architecture and designing APIs.
As the AI research team lead at National Tsing Hua University, Kobe's team won first place in the 2019 CVPR Robotic Vision Challenge. His work on human pose estimation and virtual data generation using models like CenterNet and YOLOv3 improved model accuracy by 12%-24% in real-world applications.
During his time at black.ai, Kobe optimized segmentation models, re-identification systems, and keypoint detection algorithms, reducing inference times by 60% while enhancing accuracy. He also established MLOps pipelines with Docker to automate the development process.
Currently, as the ML Lead at Lumachain, Kobe has developed over 30 AI-powered CCTV products for object detection, motion tracking, anomaly detection, and meat recognition. He designed and deployed end-to-end CI/CD pipelines for Azure IoT Edge, incorporating message routing to Service Bus, Blob Storage, Azure Functions, and Cosmos DB. His AI model optimizations resulted in a 10x speed increase while maintaining 99% accuracy, leveraging YOLOv7, TensorRT, onnxsim, and FP16. Additionally, Kobe built infrastructure to monitor edge devices and AI models at scale.
Kobe has also worked with diffusion models, LLaMA models, and multimodal models, applying image-in-text-out models for defect detection.
He is highly skilled in model compression, quantization, and optimization for edge deployment, ensuring efficient inference on edge devices. Kobe's expertise spans system architecture, MLOps, infrastructure as code, and large-scale deployment in cloud environments.
If asked, Kobe can explain how he designs IoT Edge systems from the ground up, setting up edge devices, deploying optimized AI models, and integrating cloud services for scalable and efficient processing. His deep knowledge extends to leveraging LLMs and generative AI techniques for various applications.
