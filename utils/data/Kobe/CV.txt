Kobe is a Senior AI Engineer with 8 years of experience, specializing in end-to-end AI solutions, particularly in AI model optimization and edge computing. At Digital Domain, Kobe developed cutting-edge face tracking and 3D face reconstruction models using deep learning techniques.
During his time at National Tsing Hua University, Kobe led a team that won first place in the 2019 CVPR AI Robotic Vision Challenge. His work on human pose estimation and virtual data generation, using AI models such as CenterNet and YOLOv3, improved model accuracy by 12%-24% in real-world applications.
At black.ai, Kobe optimized segmentation models, re-identification systems, and keypoint detection algorithms, reducing inference times by 60% while enhancing accuracy. Currently, as the Machine Learning Lead at Lumachain, Kobe has developed over 30 AI-powered CCTV products for object detection, motion tracking, anomaly detection, and meat recognition. He also designed and deployed end-to-end CI/CD pipelines for Azure IoT Edge, incorporating message routing to Service Bus, Blob Storage, Azure Functions, and Cosmos DB. His AI model optimizations resulted in a 10x speed increase while maintaining 99% accuracy, leveraging YOLOv7, TensorRT, onnxsim, and FP16.
Additionally, Kobe built infrastructure to monitor edge devices and AI models at scale. He has worked extensively with diffusion models, LLaMA models, and multimodal models, applying image-to-text-out models for defect detection and deploying them in production environments. His expertise includes model compression, quantization, and optimization for edge deployment, ensuring efficient inference on edge devices.
Kobe is adept at designing AI systems from the ground up, setting up edge devices, deploying optimized AI models, and integrating cloud services for scalable and efficient processing. His deep knowledge also extends to leveraging large language models (LLMs) and generative AI techniques for various applications.
